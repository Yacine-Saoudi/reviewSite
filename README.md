# reviewSite
Final project for ICS3U and will be where the movie critic site will be.
# How the project works
  The project has mutiple features.
  -The main and biggest one is the comment functionality, where the user can post comments with a username and score, it works by putting all the information gotten from an input field into an array, then appending that array.
  -the average score finder works by saving the score the user put in in an array then finding the average of that array.
  -the search bar works by using if statements, if the user enters a valid movie name, the page will change to that page. 
# What the project does
  -the project is a website that has movie reviews, the user can input his own reviews and affect the score of the film, it has a search bar, a nav bar, a comment section, and embeded youtube videos.
# How to compile the project
  -download yoeman, which allows you to scaffold, instructions here https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp, install npm by following these instructions https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm, this guide also gets node.js so you don't have to worry about that. Finally, install git here https://git-scm.com/downloads. after all this, open your command propmpt, change directory to your project (which should be installed by now) and type "gulp serve" your browser should now open  a website with your html file in it and you can now make your won webpage.

# How to test the project
  -put "debugger;" in your javascript lines if something doesnt work and figure out the issue, if you still can't find it use your "inspect element" by right-clicking your website and finding the "console" tab where the error might be displayed.
